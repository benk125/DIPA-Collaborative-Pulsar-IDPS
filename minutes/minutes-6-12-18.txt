#Minute of Project Supervision Meeting

#Student Name        :   Ben Kelly
#Project Module Code :   ELE 4001
#Project Supervisor  :   Dr Sandra Scottt-Hayward
#Meeting Number      :       8

#Progress Since Last Meeting, and Decisions arrived at during meeting:
•	Set up Apache Pulsar service ./bin/pulsar standalone
•	Crude consumer , producer setup aross two vm to check connection
•	Set up a half duplex connecction , consumer reads but isnt able to produce
•	pulsar and controllers currently on same network
•	Single controller example that will send request to pulsar when it wants to drop packet
•	Read pcap example and drop if number of telnet packets reach certain level
•	How to split over multiple subnets ?
•	format pcap using tcpick -c -yP -r rcp_dump.pcap
•	Is it ok to use alot of counters and have a crude threshold for packets reading?
•	Detailed different attacks that topics can be defined for i.e teardrop , smurf , botnet, tcp replay, syn flood
•	async comms for callback needed or not ?
•	Hard to partition and publih to 1, bad practice to publish to yourself, have to send updated just to other subnets
•	Add authentication to consumers and producers
•	Do we care about retransmission of messages.
•	Event time can be published alonside message to see how long it takes to send and process
•	batching best for latency but its put in a queue so only good for multiple requests
•	Use shared round robin config for subscription to data


#Action Points
•	Use tcpreplay < pcap file> . Dont read pcap files to process they have to be live.
•	Download pcap files but use tcprewrite to change source and destination ips / MAC addresses
•	Interim Literature review have done for 8th January for check before deadline on 11th January
•	Work on Interim demo for first week in January ~ 14th january
•	Combine current small implementations together . all components for base solution are there 
•	Try get them talking to each other on different subnets so they are isolated.
•	Assume crude threshold limits for i.e telnet traffic over time being too much.
•	Look into snort and try replicate rule of number of packets per sec
