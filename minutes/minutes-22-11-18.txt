#Minute of Project Supervision Meeting

#Student Name        :   Ben Kelly
#Project Module Code :   ELE 4001
#Project Supervisor  :   Dr Sandra Scottt-Hayward
#Meeting Number      :       7

#Progress Since Last Meeting, and Decisions arrived at during meeting:
•	Looked into faucet as an option but realised ryu is better for thid implementation
•	Looked at differnt ryu ddos mitigators, NOt many and alot hard coded
•	Found example file of helping to prevent tcp floods and change packet priority which can be used as the base app for ddos detection
•	Revisted Gantt Chart and with estimated timeline and added major deadlines
•	Experimented with Xterm to login toeach hosts a, replicating a ddos attack, i.e 1 host curling http server on h2 , h3 will run hping3 with 1million tcp packets which will slow the attack
•	Used demonstration attack with priority packets ddos detection app to mitigate
•	Looked into traffic monitor.py which will bild a nice table representation of data
•	https://github.com/knetsolutions
•	Use Knet solution for better formatted gui demonstration , ryu inbuilt gui isnt reliable enough, and hard to visually represent topology and attacks clearly
•	How to block an Attack without just bloxking an p , as mirai is distributed. Does behaviour need to be learned?
•	Use for multiple flow rule tables in controllers ???
•	Monitor at intervals for packets per second before writing flow rule


#Action Points
•	Use example attack to represent what will happen if my system is not in place
•	Draft of interim Report shoud be written by 14th December to allow correction for deadline on 11th January
•	Assume behaviour types from attacks i.e mirai - suspicioues telnet traffic , or the increase of traffic on ports, Hardcode thresholds to alert attacks to pulsar
•	Start thinking of Interim Demonstration
•	Explore Apache pulsar and try get it writing a topic based event when priority rule flow rule set
