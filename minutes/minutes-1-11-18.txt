#Minute of Project Supervision Meeting

#Student Name        :   Ben Kelly
#Project Module Code :   ELE 4001
#Project Supervisor  :   Dr Sandra Scottt-Hayward
#Meeting Number      :       4

#Progress Since Last Meeting, and Decisions arrived at during meeting:
•	Set priority list of what should be done first and make a start on some practical aspects
•	Setup Mininet vm
•	Setup Ryu on a separate VM ( this should be changed to run on the same vm as mininet as we are note testing ryu and mininet connection
•	Looked at miniedit which is a ui toplolgy builder to create toplogy of switches/controllers/hosts to show physical links
•	Tested creating a mininet network using :
•	sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --controller remote --switch ovsk




#Action Points
•	Look at antispoofing devices that will work with ddos app
•	Concern : to run multiple VMs might be too taxing performance wise for laptop . Try delegate small amount of storage and see if 16GB RAM will be enough to power 3 VMs at one time.
•	Sort out communication error to find the rules that ryu will right to the switches
•	See how Pulsar works and communicates. Devise a simple but effective way to pass malicious information from ryu controller and build topics in pulsar
•	Use wireshark alongside yru and mininet to check it is picking up malicious traffic.
•	Search for Malicious network Pcaps.
•	Manage time and resources better. Set aside minimum 10 hours a week on project .
