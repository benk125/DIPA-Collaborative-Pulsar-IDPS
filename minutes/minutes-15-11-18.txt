#Minute of Project Supervision Meeting

#Student Name        :   Ben Kelly
#Project Module Code :   ELE 4001
#Project Supervisor  :   Dr Sandra Scottt-Hayward
#Meeting Number      :       6

#Progress Since Last Meeting, and Decisions arrived at during meeting:
•	Sorted Gitlab 2 issues (CSB admin created new user account)
•	Moved minutes to .txt files and version controlled documents. Give Sandra reporter Access
•	Found Ryuretic , which simpiflies header elements to a pkt dictionary
•	https://github.com/Ryuretic/RyureticLabs/blob/master/ryu/ryu/app/Ryuretic/Ryuretic.py
•	Looked At ddos mitigation app - Alot are openstate except for this one however it is very statically set
•	https://github.com/mishra14/DDoSAttackMitigationSystem
•	Explored using adding new flow rule that would drop the packet (*problems with it setting every packet to 1)
•	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFShXmWJn1E - good ryu ddos mitigation but no full source code
•	Should the flow rules be deleted with OFPFC_DELETE
•	Can curl and change priority and add new flow rules just problems coding
•	Fixed Mininet small resolution size via compiling guest additions manually
•	Is Faucet appriopriate to use for this project


#Action Points
•	Pass PCAPs to mininet that are accessible or make my own usign Scapy
•	use tcpdump / tcpreplay to build pcap files to emulate overflow of tables
•	Xterm h1 will take you into the host , try this with hping3 which will ping other hosts under ddos conditions
•	Use iperf when coming to measure throughput ad load testing
•	Dont delete flow rules , DDos attack with send from different sources so deleting will do nothing
•	Group range of ips to prevent mirai botnet but also to let legit traffic through
•	Read Enabling Co-operative IOT security via software defined Networks (SDN)
•	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01885.pdf
•	Read a RYU SDN DDOS  research implementation paper to gain better understanding
•	Produce a flowchart / psuedo Code of each action the SDN should do
•	Build off DDoSAttackMitigationSystem but make it dynamic and make sure it does the basic SDN talking functions
