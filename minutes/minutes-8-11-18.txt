#Minute of Project Supervision Meeting

#Student Name        :   Ben Kelly
#Project Module Code :   ELE 4001
#Project Supervisor  :   Dr Sandra Scottt-Hayward
#Meeting Number      :       5

#Progress Since Last Meeting, and Decisions arrived at during meeting:
•	Signed up to gns3 Practical SDN and openflow fundamentals to understand terminiology
•	Learend different usage of SDN i.e network automations , control flow , baremetal switching 
•	Learend layer topology of sdn i.e application lauer , control layer and instrafrsutrcutre layer and omposed diagram of what “app” represents each 
•	Use openflow for south bound interface and apache pulsar rest api for north bound
•	Revisted normal switch activity and compared it with SDN
•	Reactive and proactive flow entreis in switches . Experiment heavily relies on reactive so ryu controller will need to sit on the same host as mininet to reduce latency
•	Looked at opendaylight but not suitable
•	Nat and host only adapters don’t work together on vms 
•	Ryu switch commands 


#Action Points
•	For host oly networks looks at internal network .
•	Mininet guide to making screen bigger
•	Look at SDN snort as an original setup i.e snort box which this setup should replace
•	Don’t look at openstate further as it uses stateful
•	Change priority rules to block packets 
•	Group rules by ip ranges to keep flow entry table clean and not cause performance drops
•	Check how long entries last in tables before deleteing
