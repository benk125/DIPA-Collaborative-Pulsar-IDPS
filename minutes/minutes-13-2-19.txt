#Minute of Project Supervision Meeting

#Student Name        :   Ben Kelly
#Project Module Code :   ELE 4001
#Project Supervisor  :   Dr Sandra Scottt-Hayward
#Meeting Number      :       11

#Progress Since Last Meeting, and Decisions arrived at during meeting:
•	Added Timing to measure control plane and latency between pulsar and vms
•	Average, min, max and standard deviation of time from all vms , take max for multiple vms
•	Threaded Pulsar hub consumer to subscribe to all vms and thread receive updates from them
•	NTP issues fixed by using PTP to sync the times using a master slave and adding the offset of masters to the slaves
•	Added global cummulative solution to distinguish an attack from a global level if not triggered from local
•	Work out standard deviation of global attacks only if multiple subnets are producing results

#Action Points
•	Start producing test results for critical analysis for wednesday 27th.
•	critical analysis - openstack neutron and apache pulsar in cloud 
•	Look at running bengin traffic on each hosts by looping over a pcapusing tcpreplay and using mininet python script 
•	Test Cases : differnet loads, iperf on control and vm/pulsar link , differnt polling times and tradeoffs.
•	Make Sure flow rules are blocking Ip addresses and not MAC addresses
•	Look at how distributing pulsar will mitigiate exploitations
