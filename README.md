# DIPA-Collaborative-Pulsar-IDPS
Collaborative intrusion detection and prevention system using apache pulsar ( pub sub ) framework . Distributed architecture used in the cloud (AWS). This project investigates recent evolution in the mirai botnet attacks . The proposed architecture utilizes a deployed AWS distributed series of clusters with apache pulsar installed . Classified attacks are pushed to the pub sub framework , this results in neighbouring domains consuming alerts.

## Getting Started
This project takes results from a a series of deployed instances , however there are a variety of experimental and developmental test files used for local experimentation.
